# Face-detection-project

Objective:
The objective of the project is to implement real-time face detection using OpenCV. The script captures video from a webcam, processes each frame to detect faces, and draws rectangles around detected faces.

Tools and Technologies Used:-

OpenCV: A computer vision library used for real-time image processing.

Python: The programming language used to write the script.
